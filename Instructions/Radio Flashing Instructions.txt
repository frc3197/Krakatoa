1. Reflash the radio
  a. When loading up the configuration tool, choose "Ethernet" on the first window.
  b. Unplug the power from the radio
  c. Click "Load Firmware"
  d. When the window shows up, plug in the power to the radio
  e. Wait for flashing to complete
2. Configure radio
  a. Turn off wifi in Network and Internet Settings (fuly disable) before configuring
  b. That's it. What else did you think you'd have to do?

Note - Reflashing the radio is important. If you just cycle the power and the radio is still powered when you begin
       to load firmware, something messes up and then the Configuration also messes up.
       In addition, you have to disable all network adapters. That includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
