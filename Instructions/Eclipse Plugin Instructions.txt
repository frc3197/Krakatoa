When Eclipse starts:

Select "Help"
Click "Install new software".
From here you need to add a software update site, the location where the plugins will be downloaded. Push the "Add..." button then fill in the "Add Repository" dialog with:
Name: FRC Plugins
Location: http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/eclipse/
Click "OK".
